## How To Execute?

**<span style="color:red; font-weight:1000;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span>** Don't render _index.html_ on browser using the file system path (absolute file path), instead you have to render it using localhost by a local server (<span style="color:crimson; font-weight:500;">Otherwize the web-application won't behave correctly</span>). Feel free to use any local server you're comforable with.
In my device I used VScode extention called **_Live Server_**.

### Installing Live Server on VScode

- press: on linux `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Ctrl + P` on windows, to open VScode Command Palette
- paste this line to download and install LiveServer: `ext install ritwickdey.liveserver`

### Execute project using Live Server

- open the directory of the project.
- right click on `index.html`.
- click on `Open with Live Server`.
  Then it should aumatically open the project on your default browser as local host
